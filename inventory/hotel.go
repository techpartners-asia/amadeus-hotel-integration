// Package inventory answers "which hotels exist, and where".
//
// It is the bounded context over Amadeus's Hotel List API. Its concern is
// locating properties, not describing them and not pricing them: a Hotel here
// carries an identity, a position and enough address to show on a map. For a
// property's rooms, facilities and photographs use the content context; for
// what a stay costs use the offers context.
//
// The Amadeus name for this API is "Hotel List". The context is called
// inventory because "list" names a mechanism rather than a concept, and would
// collide with the verb on every other service.
