// Package offers answers "what does a stay at this hotel cost, and can I book
// it".
//
// It is the bounded context over Amadeus's Hotel Search API. The central term
// is the Offer: a bookable rate for a room over a date range, at a price, under
// a set of policies. An offer is not a room. One physical room appears in many
// offers that differ by rate code, board type, cancellation policy and price -
// which is why GroupByRoom exists, and why a room-picker UI needs it.
//
// The offer ID produced here is what the booking context takes to make a
// reservation. Offer IDs are short-lived: Amadeus expires them, and a stale one
// fails at booking time rather than at search time.
