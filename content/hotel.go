// Package content describes a hotel: its rooms, facilities, policies,
// photographs and surroundings.
//
// It is the bounded context over Amadeus's Hotel Content API. Its concern is
// what a property is like, not where it is (that is inventory) and not what it
// costs (that is offers). Nothing here is priced or bookable, and nothing here
// changes per stay - which is why content is worth caching and an offer is not.
//
// Almost every field is optional. What a property publishes varies enormously
// by source: a chain hotel may return rooms, facilities, awards and fifty
// photographs, while an aggregator listing returns a name and an address. The
// pointer and slice fields below are absent far more often than the schema
// suggests, so check before dereferencing.
