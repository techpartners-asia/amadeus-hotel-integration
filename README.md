# iTrip Hotel SDK for Go

A Go client for the [Amadeus Hotel APIs](https://developers.amadeus.com/):
finding hotels, pricing stays, describing properties and making reservations.

```go
client, err := sdk.New(sdk.Config{
    ClientID:     os.Getenv("AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID"),
    ClientSecret: os.Getenv("AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET"),
    Environment:  sdk.Test,
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

hotels, err := client.Inventory.ByCity(ctx, inventory.CityQuery{CityCode: "PAR"})
```

Amadeus's JSON never reaches your code. Prices arrive as `money.Money`, dates as
`datetime.Date`, and enumerations as typed codes that fail to compile when wrong.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.25** or later.
- **Amadeus Enterprise credentials.** These endpoints target the Enterprise
  travel gateway. Self-service credentials from the developer portal are
  rejected with a `403`.

No third-party dependencies. The SDK uses only the standard library.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration
```

---

## Architecture

The SDK is four **bounded contexts**, each a package you import for its own
types. They are drawn on the seams the business has, not on Amadeus's URLs.

| Context | Package | Answers | Amadeus API |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | `inventory` | Which hotels exist, and where? | Hotel List v1.2 |
| **Content** | `content` | What is this property like? | Hotel Content v3.1 |
| **Offers** | `offers` | What does a stay cost? | Hotel Search v3.5 |
| **Booking** | `booking` | Reserve it, and manage the reservation | Hotel Booking v2.x |

```
        codes/  money/  geo/  datetime/  media/     <- shared value objects
              ^     ^     ^       ^        ^
   +----------+-----+-----+-------+--------+--------+
   |                                                |
inventory --> content                  offers --> booking
 (find it)     (describe it)          (price it)  (buy it)
```

Contexts never import each other's services — only values that cross the
boundary, such as a hotel ID or an offer ID.

### The anti-corruption layer

Every Amadeus wire structure lives under `internal/`. Go forbids importing
`internal/` from outside the module, so **you cannot accidentally depend on
Amadeus's JSON shapes** — it is a compile error, not a convention. Each
context's `mapper.go` is the only code that sees both sides.

What that buys you:

| Amadeus sends | You get |
|---|---|
| `"total": "120.50"` beside `"currency": "EUR"` | `money.Money` — exact, currency attached |
| `"checkInDate": "2026-08-10"` | `datetime.Date` — no timezone to shift it |
| `"isLoyaltyRate": "true"` (a **string**) | `bool` |
| `"boardType": "BREAKFAST"` + a doc comment listing the rest | `codes.BoardType` |
| `latitude` and `longitude` as separate floats | `geo.Coordinates`, or `nil` if unknown |
| `cancellation` **and** `cancellations`, often duplicated | one deduplicated list |

---

## Quick start

The usual flow — find hotels, price them, book one:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
    "time"

    sdk "github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration"
    "github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration/codes"
    "github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration/datetime"
    "github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration/inventory"
    "github.com/techpartners-asia/amadeus-hotel-integration/offers"
)

func main() {
    client, err := sdk.New(sdk.Config{
        ClientID:     os.Getenv("AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID"),
        ClientSecret: os.Getenv("AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET"),
        Environment:  sdk.Test,
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 60*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    // 1. Which hotels are in Paris?
    hotels, err := client.Inventory.ByCity(ctx, inventory.CityQuery{
        CityCode: "PAR",
        Filters: inventory.Filters{
            Radius:  5,
            Ratings: []codes.Rating{codes.Rating4, codes.Rating5},
        },
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // 2. What do they cost for three nights in August?
    checkIn := datetime.MustParseDate("2026-08-10")
    results, err := client.Offers.Search(ctx, offers.SearchQuery{
        HotelIDs: inventory.IDs(hotels)[:20], // at most 100 per search
        Stay:     offers.Stay{CheckIn: checkIn, CheckOut: checkIn.AddDays(3)},
        Guests:   offers.Guests{Adults: 2},
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    for _, result := range results {
        offer, ok := result.Cheapest()
        if !ok {
            continue
        }
        refundable, certain := offer.Policies.IsRefundable()
        fmt.Printf("%-40s %10s  refundable=%v (certain=%v)\n",
            result.Hotel.Name, offer.Price.Total, refundable, certain)
    }
}
```

---

## Inventory — finding hotels

Three ways to find properties. All return `[]inventory.Hotel`.

```go
// Around a city or airport code
hotels, err := client.Inventory.ByCity(ctx, inventory.CityQuery{
    CityCode: "PAR",
    Filters: inventory.Filters{
        Radius:     10,
        RadiusUnit: geo.Kilometers,          // KM or MILE only
        ChainCodes: []string{"HL", "MC"},
        Amenities:  []codes.Amenity{codes.AmenitySwimmingPool},
        Ratings:    []codes.Rating{codes.Rating5},  // at most 4
        Source:     codes.HotelSourceDirectChain,
    },
})

// Around a point
hotels, err := client.Inventory.ByGeocode(ctx, inventory.GeocodeQuery{
    Position: geo.Coordinates{Latitude: 48.8566, Longitude: 2.3522},
    Filters:  inventory.Filters{Radius: 5},
})

// By property code
hotels, err := client.Inventory.ByIDs(ctx, inventory.IDsQuery{
    HotelIDs: []string{"MCLONGHM", "ACPAR419"},
})
```

### What you get

```go
type Hotel struct {
    ID                 HotelID           // 8-char Amadeus property code
    Name               string
    ChainCode          string            // and BrandCode, MasterChainCode
    DupeID             string            // groups the same property across sources
    IATACode           string
    Position           *geo.Coordinates  // nil when Amadeus cannot locate it
    Address            *Address          // nil when Amadeus sent none
    DistanceFromSearch *geo.Distance     // set by ByCity/ByGeocode, nil for ByIDs
    Sponsored          bool              // paid placement — worth surfacing
    LastUpdate         string
}
```

`Position` is a pointer on purpose. `0,0` is a real point in the Gulf of Guinea;
defaulting an unlocatable property to it would put it in the Atlantic and it
would pass a non-zero check.

`inventory.IDs(hotels)` extracts the property codes for the other contexts.

---

## Offers — pricing a stay

```go
results, err := client.Offers.Search(ctx, offers.SearchQuery{
    HotelIDs: ids,                                    // required, <= 100
    Stay:     offers.Stay{CheckIn: in, CheckOut: out},
    Guests:   offers.Guests{Adults: 2, ChildAges: []int{7, 12}},
    Rooms:    1,

    BoardType:     codes.BoardTypeBreakfast,
    PaymentPolicy: codes.PaymentPolicyGuarantee,
    Currency:      "EUR",
    PriceRange:    "100-400",          // requires Currency

    BestRateOnly: codes.Ptr(false),    // false = every rate, not just cheapest
})
```

### Prices are money, not strings

```go
offer := results[0].Offers[0]

offer.Price.Total          // money.Money — "600 EUR"
offer.Price.Base           // before taxes
offer.Price.SellingTotal   // including markups

// Taxes carry their own semantics
taxes, _ := offer.Price.TaxesTotal()            // excludes taxes already in Base
onArrival, _ := offer.Price.PayableAtProperty() // city tax, tourist tax...

// A nightly rate, with the remainder rather than silent rounding
perNight, remainder, ok := offer.Price.PerNight(offer.Stay.Nights())
```

`PayableAtProperty` is frequently non-zero. Showing a guest only the booking
total understates what they will actually pay.

### Refundability is answered honestly

```go
refundable, certain := offer.Policies.IsRefundable()
if !certain {
    // Amadeus did not say clearly. Do NOT tell the guest it is refundable.
}

if deadline, ok := offer.Policies.FreeCancellationUntil(); ok {
    fmt.Println("Free cancellation until", deadline)
}
```

Amadeus expresses refundability three different ways that do not always agree.
`IsRefundable` reconciles them and reports `certain=false` when it cannot —
because presenting a non-refundable rate as refundable costs a real person real
money.

### Grouping offers by room

An offer is a **bookable rate**, not a room. One room appears in many offers
differing by rate code, board type and cancellation policy. A room picker wants
the inverse:

```go
// Requires BestRateOnly: codes.Ptr(false) on the search.
for _, room := range results[0].GroupByRoom() {
    fmt.Printf("%s — from %s (%d rates)\n",
        room.Room.Description, room.PriceFrom, len(room.Offers))
}
```

Groups are ordered by cheapest price, then room type; offers within a group by
price, then ID. An offer with no usable price sorts last and never becomes the
"cheapest" unless it is the only one.

### Re-checking a price before booking

```go
detail, err := client.Offers.Get(ctx, offers.GetQuery{OfferID: offer.ID})
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrNotFound) {
    // The offer expired. Search again.
}
```

**Offer IDs expire.** Treat one as good for the current user session and no
longer.

---

## Content — describing a property

```go
hotel, err := client.Content.Get(ctx, content.Query{
    HotelID: "HLPAR266",
    Lang:    "FR",         // falls back to English where untranslated
})
```

The SDK requests the `FULL` view by default. Amadeus's own default returns only
the basic block, which is almost never what you want.

```go
hotel.Name, hotel.Rating, hotel.Description
hotel.Rooms            // room types, with dimensions, occupancy, amenities
hotel.Facilities       // meeting rooms, restaurants, shared amenities
hotel.Policies         // payment, check-in, pets, tax, guest age rules
hotel.Awards           // ratings and certifications
hotel.PointsOfInterest // notable places nearby
hotel.NearbyLandmarks  // with distances, comparable across units

if position, ok := hotel.Position(); ok { /* ... */ }
if photo, ok := hotel.PrimaryPhoto(); ok {
    thumbnail := photo.Best(400)  // picks a rendition, not the original
}
```

**Almost every field is optional.** What a property publishes varies enormously
by source: a chain hotel returns rooms, facilities and fifty photographs; an
aggregator listing returns a name and an address. Absent blocks are `nil`, so
you can tell "not published" from "published empty".

Content does not change per stay, so it is worth caching. An offer is not.

> Property-level `Policies` here are descriptive. The terms that actually bind a
> reservation are on the **offer**. Where the two disagree, the offer wins.

---

## Booking — making a reservation

> Against `sdk.Production` this charges a real card and creates a real
> reservation.

```go
order, err := client.Booking.Create(ctx, booking.Reservation{
    Guests: []booking.Guest{{
        ID:        1,                   // your own ID, referenced by Rooms
        Title:     "MS",
        FirstName: "Ada",
        LastName:  "Lovelace",
        Email:     "ada@example.com",
        Phone:     "+33679278416",
    }},
    Rooms: []booking.RoomRequest{{
        OfferID:        offer.ID.String(),
        GuestIDs:       []int{1},       // first is the main guest
        SpecialRequest: "High floor if possible",
    }},
    Payment: booking.Payment{
        Method: booking.PaymentCreditCard,
        Card: &booking.Card{
            VendorCode: "VI",
            Number:     "4111111111111111",
            Expiry:     "1230",         // MMYY or YYYY-MM
            HolderName: "ADA LOVELACE",
            ThreeDS:    &booking.ThreeDSecure{ /* mandatory for EU cards */ },
        },
    },
    Agent: booking.Agent{Email: "agency@example.com"},
})
```

**Persist `order.ID` immediately.** It is the only handle to the reservation;
without it you cannot retrieve or cancel.

### Checking a booking

```go
b := order.Bookings[0]

b.Status.IsActive()          // CONFIRMED, ON_HOLD or PAST
b.Status.IsCancelled()

if number, ok := b.ConfirmationNumber(); ok {
    // What the guest quotes at the desk
}
```

`IsActive()` deliberately **excludes `PENDING`**. An on-request booking the
hotel has not accepted is not a room, and reporting it as one sends a guest to a
property with no reservation.

### Managing it

```go
order, err := client.Booking.Get(ctx, orderID)
order, err := client.Booking.GetByReference(ctx, "JKL789")

// Will cancelling cost anything, right now?
free, certain := b.Offer.Policies.CanCancelFreeOfCharge(time.Now())

order, err := client.Booking.Cancel(ctx, orderID, bookingID)
order, err := client.Booking.Modify(ctx, orderID, bookingID, booking.Modification{
    Stay: &newStay,   // only the fields you set are sent
})
result, err := client.Booking.Delete(ctx, orderID, bookingID)
```

`CanCancelFreeOfCharge` takes the current time because the guest's real question
is "can I *still* cancel?", which depends on the deadline not having passed —
not merely on one existing.

### Validation before anything is charged

Booking validates harder than the rest of the SDK. A malformed search costs a
round trip; a malformed booking either fails after the guest was told it
succeeded, or succeeds on terms nobody chose. Checked locally:

- Guest IDs unique, and every room's guest reference resolves.
- Card numbers pass the **Luhn checksum** — a transposed digit becomes a named
  error rather than an opaque decline.
- Names match Amadeus's letters-and-spaces rule (which rejects accents).
- Expiry, CVV and vendor-code formats.

**Card numbers never appear in an error message.** Validation errors get logged;
a card number must not travel with them.

---

## Value objects

### `money` — exact prices

Amadeus sends prices as decimal strings. `strconv.ParseFloat` loses precision on
values a hotel bill can contain, so `money.Amount` is fixed-point.

```go
total := offer.Price.Total          // money.Money
total.Amount()                      // exact decimal
total.Currency()                    // "EUR"
total.String()                      // "600 EUR"

sum, err := a.Add(b)                   // errors on mixed currencies
part, remainder, ok := total.Split(3)  // remainder returned, not rounded away
```

`0.1 + 0.2` is exactly `0.3` here.

### `datetime` — calendar dates

A check-in date is a date, not an instant. Parsing `"2026-08-10"` into a
`time.Time` forces a timezone on it, and formatting it elsewhere can move the
booking by a day.

```go
checkIn := datetime.MustParseDate("2026-08-10")
nights := checkIn.DaysUntil(checkOut)
checkIn.AddDays(3)
```

### `geo` — coordinates and distances

```go
geo.Coordinates{Latitude: 48.8566, Longitude: 2.3522}
distance.Meters()   // compare a radius quoted in miles against one in km
```

### `media` — images and text

```go
photo.Best(400)   // nearest rendition <= 400px, rather than the original
photo.Alt         // the only accessible description Amadeus supplies
```

---

## Search filter codes

Typed constants for everything Amadeus accepts in a filter, so a wrong code
fails to compile instead of returning a `400`.

```go
codes.AmenitySwimmingPool
codes.Rating5
codes.BoardTypeBreakfast
codes.PaymentPolicyGuarantee
codes.HotelSourceDirectChain
codes.ContentViewFull
codes.RateCodePublic
```

Enumerate them for a filter UI, with or without a client:

```go
for _, a := range codes.AllAmenities() {
    fmt.Println(a, a.Label())   // "SWIMMING_POOL  Swimming Pool"
}

// Or through the client, if that is more convenient to pass around
client.Codes.Amenities()
```

These are static data compiled into the SDK. Nothing here calls Amadeus.

### Two codes differ from the Amadeus documentation

The live API **rejects** two codes exactly as Amadeus documents them:

| Documented | Actually accepted |
|---|---|
| `BABY-SITTING` | `BABY_SITTING` |
| `BAR or LOUNGE` | `BAR_LOUNGE` |

The constants use the working forms.

### Rate codes are not a closed set

`codes.RateCode` accepts any 3-character code, because corporate codes are
negotiated per account and cannot be enumerated. `AllRateCodes()` returns the
documented public and qualified rates only — a starting list for a UI, not a
whitelist. `IsValid()` checks the *shape*, not membership.

---

## Errors

Two ways to inspect a failure.

```go
// Which kind of failure was it?
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrNotFound)    { /* no such hotel, or an expired offer */ }
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrRateLimited) { /* back off */ }
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrServer)      { /* Amadeus's side — worth retrying */ }
if errors.Is(err, sdk.ErrValidation)  { /* your request; never sent */ }

// What exactly did Amadeus say?
var apiErr *sdk.APIError
if errors.As(err, &apiErr) {
    for _, d := range apiErr.Details {
        fmt.Println(d.Code, d.Title, d.Detail, d.Source)
    }
}
```

| Sentinel | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ErrValidation` | — | Rejected by the SDK before sending; names the field |
| `ErrInvalidRequest` | 400 | Amadeus rejected the request |
| `ErrUnauthorized` | 401 | Bad credentials, or a token that could not refresh |
| `ErrForbidden` | 403 | Valid credentials, not entitled. Self-service keys land here |
| `ErrNotFound` | 404 | No such hotel, offer or order — including an expired offer |
| `ErrRateLimited` | 429 | Per-second or per-month quota |
| `ErrServer` | 5xx | Amadeus's side |

Validation failures name the offending field, and report **every** problem at
once rather than one per round trip:

```go
var errs sdk.ValidationErrors
if errors.As(err, &errs) {
    for _, e := range errs {
        fmt.Printf("%s: %s\n", e.Field, e.Reason)
    }
}
```

Amadeus sometimes returns `200` with an `errors` array and no usable data. The
SDK treats that as a failure, not a success with an empty result.

---

## Configuration

```go
sdk.Config{
    ClientID:     "...",              // required
    ClientSecret: "...",              // required
    Environment:  sdk.Production,     // defaults to sdk.Test

    HTTPClient: myClient,             // proxying, TLS, instrumentation
    Timeout:    90 * time.Second,     // used when HTTPClient is nil; default 60s
    UserAgent:  "my-app/1.0",

    SkipCredentialCheck: false,       // true defers auth to the first call
}
```

`Environment` defaults to `Test` deliberately: a forgotten setting gives you
sandbox data, not a real charge.

Several clients can coexist in one process — different environments, different
tenants — each with its own token.

```go
if err := client.Ping(ctx); err != nil { /* health check */ }
```

Every method takes a `context.Context` as its first argument, so cancellation,
deadlines and tracing all work.

---

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...                    # offline; no credentials, no network
```

Three layers:

1. **Mapper tests** (default) — each context decodes a recorded Amadeus response
   from its `testdata/` and asserts field by field. This is the regression
   suite, and it runs anywhere.

2. **Fixture capture** (on demand) — record fresh responses from the sandbox:

   ```bash
   AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=... AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=... go run ./internal/capture
   go test ./...   # a failure now is a field Amadeus changed
   ```

   It never captures booking responses: creating an order on the sandbox is
   still a booking, and a tool must not make one as a side effect.

3. **Live suite** (build-tagged) — end-to-end against the sandbox:

   ```bash
   AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=... AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=... go test -tags live ./livetest/ -v
   ```

Testing your own code against the SDK: every service is an interface, so
substitute a fake.

```go
type stubOffers struct{ offers.Service }

func (stubOffers) Search(context.Context, offers.SearchQuery) ([]offers.HotelOffers, error) {
    return []offers.HotelOffers{ /* ... */ }, nil
}
```

---

## Migrating from the previous version

The public API changed completely. Everything below is a straight substitution.

### Construction

```go
// before
client, err := sdk.New(id, secret)

// after
client, err := sdk.New(sdk.Config{ClientID: id, ClientSecret: secret})
```

Production used to require editing `constants/url.go`. Now set
`Environment: sdk.Production`.

### Method names

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `client.List.HotelListByCityCode(req)` | `client.Inventory.ByCity(ctx, query)` |
| `client.List.HotelListByGeocode(req)` | `client.Inventory.ByGeocode(ctx, query)` |
| `client.List.HotelListByHotelIds(req)` | `client.Inventory.ByIDs(ctx, query)` |
| `client.Offers.List(req)` | `client.Offers.Search(ctx, query)` |
| `client.Offers.GetByID(req)` | `client.Offers.Get(ctx, query)` |
| `client.Content.GetByID(req)` | `client.Content.Get(ctx, query)` |
| `client.Booking.Create(req)` | `client.Booking.Create(ctx, reservation)` |
| `client.SearchCriteria` | `client.Codes` |
| `searchcriteria.*` | `codes.*` |

**Every method now takes a `context.Context` first.**

### Types

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `responseHotelListDTO.GeneralInfoResponse` | `inventory.Hotel` |
| `responseHotelOffersDTO.OffersResponse` | `offers.HotelOffers` |
| `responseContentDTO.HotelContentResponse` | `content.Hotel` |
| `responseBookingDTO.HotelOrder` | `booking.Order` |
| `sharedResponseDTO.APIError` | `sdk.APIError` |
| `searchcriteria.RadiusUnit` | `geo.Unit` |

### Field changes to expect

- **Prices** are `money.Money`, not `string`. `offer.Price.Total.String()` for
  display; `.Amount()` and `.Currency()` for the parts.
- **Dates** are `datetime.Date`, not `string`.
- **`IsLoyaltyRate`** is a `bool`, not the string `"true"`.
- **`GeoCode`** is `*geo.Coordinates` and is `nil` when unknown — check it.
- **Cancellation policies** are one merged `[]CancellationPolicy` rather than
  separate `Cancellation` and `Cancellations` fields.
- **`Offers.Get`** returns `*OfferDetail` (hotel plus offer), not a bare offer.
- **`modules/list`** is now `inventory`; **`Services`** on an offer is now
  `Extras`.

### Behaviour that changed

- Invalid requests are rejected locally with `ErrValidation` before any network
  call, instead of returning an Amadeus `400`.
- A `200` response carrying an `errors` array is now an error.
- A `401` on a cached token triggers one silent refresh and retry.
